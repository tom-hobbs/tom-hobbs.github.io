        <h1>Mitochondrial lactate dehydrogenase</h1>
        <p>Current understanding of intracellular lactate metabolism places lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) on the external side of the inner mitochondrial 
            membrane (Glancy et al., 2021), suggesting that lactate is not directly oxidised inside the mitochondrial matrix. However, recent evidence 
            strongly suggests the presence of a lactate pool in the mitochondrial matrix. To re-examine the consequences of matrix LDH activity, I have 
            adapted an existing in silico flux-balance analysis (FBA) metabolic model of the whole cell. The results show that mitochondrial LDH 
            activity is metabolically advantageous at high ATP synthesis rates, with important implications for exercise metabolism.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <h3>Testing the model</h3>

        <p>The first thing I did was to simulate the optimal carbon efficiency at different ATP synthesis rates using enzyme-constrained FBA. This formed a Pareto front, 
            showing maximum attainable substrate efficiency at a given rate of ATP synthesis. Surprisingly, the inclusion of LDHm/MCTm improves substrate efficiency at high 
            rates of ATP synthesis compared to both classical understanding, and the model including reversed mal-asp shuttle. Additionally, this does not require the 
            reversed mal-asp shuttle, as the model including LDHm/MCTm was unchanged by removal  </p>

        <p>The next question I had was why the inclusion of LDHm/MCTm improved substrate efficiency beyond the reversed mal-asp shuttle, since both strategies function 
            via a similar mechanism of NADH export from the mitochondrial matrix. The first hypothesis I had was that in the original model, NADH export may become limited by enzymatic constraints on the reversed mal-asp 
            shuttle. However, when analysing the original model . This reaction has no enzymatic contraints. 
        </p>

        <p>I next performed the same analyses using pFBA with both enzyme constraints and protein allocation constraints. The resulting
            Pareto front shows that the difference between the model including LDHm/MCTm and the original model disappears. In fact, the Pareto front for these 
            two models is identical. 

        </p>

        <h3>Validating the model against <i>in vivo</i> data</h3>
        <p>In the original paper, the multi-tissue model is validated against gas exchange data. I wanted to check if this simplified model would also accurately represent rates of
            intramuscular reaction fluxes measured <i>in vivo</i>. To do this, I contacted Dr Bartlett who provided me with original data from a 31P-MRS imaging study performed on human quadricep muscle during 
            continuous isotonic knee extension exercise last 4 minuites. The data from the study allow an estimation of ATP synthesis by each major pathway; that is, 
            glycolysis, mitochondrial ATP synthase, and phosphocreatine (PCr) breakdown. 

            FBA analysis assumes steady-state concentrates of intramusuclar metabolites (except certain specific cases, including input carbon sources and lactate excretion). 
            However, in the first seconds of exercise a large amount of phosphocreatine (PCr) is broken down to regenerate ATP. This PCr store is absent from the model. When filtering 
            out approximately the first ~60 seconds of data (to obtain steady-state PCr concentrations), the data from Dr Bartlett's study correspond closely to the reaction fluxes 
            predicted in the LDHm/MCTm model. 
        </p>


        <p>In order to determine which model occurs in vivo, I next sought potential ways to experimentally differentiate between the two models. The first step was to identify reactions
            which carry different fluxes at a given rate of ATP synthesis. I therefore wrote a short python script to check which reactions differ between the two models at a given ATP flux.
            This produced the following list:
            <br>
            ['HMR_3949', 'HMR_4139', 'HMR_4141', 'HMR_4388', 'HMR_4926', 'MT_LDH', 'MT_MCT']
            <br>
            Because the LDHm and original models produce identical O2 conspumtion curves, they would be challenging to differentiate experimentally in vivo. 
            The only reactions which
            differ between 
        </p>
