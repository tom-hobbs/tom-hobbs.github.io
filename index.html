        <h1>Mitochondrial lactate dehydrogenase</h1>
        <p>Current understanding of intracellular lactate metabolism places lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) on the external side of the inner mitochondrial 
            membrane <a class="cite" href="#ref1" id="cite1">1</a>, suggesting that lactate is not directly oxidised inside the mitochondrial matrix. However, recent evidence 
            strongly suggests the presence of a lactate pool in the mitochondrial matrix. To re-examine the consequences of matrix LDH activity, I have 
            adapted an existing in silico flux-balance analysis (FBA) metabolic model of the whole cell. The results show that mitochondrial LDH 
            activity is metabolically advantageous at high ATP synthesis rates, with important implications for exercise metabolism.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <h3>Testing the model</h3>

        <p>The first thing I did was to simulate the optimal carbon efficiency at different ATP synthesis rates using enzyme-constrained FBA. This formed a Pareto front, 
            showing maximum attainable substrate efficiency at a given rate of ATP synthesis. Surprisingly, the inclusion of LDHm/MCTm improves substrate efficiency at high 
            rates of ATP synthesis compared to both classical understanding, and the model including reversed mal-asp shuttle. Additionally, this does not require the 
            reversed mal-asp shuttle, as the model including LDHm/MCTm was unchanged by removal  </p>

        <p>The next question I had was why the inclusion of LDHm/MCTm improved substrate efficiency beyond the reversed mal-asp shuttle, since both strategies function 
            via a similar mechanism of NADH export from the mitochondrial matrix. The first hypothesis I had was that in the original model, NADH export may become limited by enzymatic constraints on the reversed mal-asp 
            shuttle. However, when analysing the original model . This reaction has no enzymatic contraints. 
        </p>

        <p>I next performed the same analyses using pFBA with both enzyme constraints and protein allocation constraints. The resulting
            Pareto front shows that the difference between the model including LDHm/MCTm and the original model disappears. In fact, the Pareto front for these 
            two models is identical. 

        </p>

        <h3>Validating the model against <i>in vivo</i> data</h3>
        <p>In the original paper, the multi-tissue model is validated against gas exchange data. I wanted to check if this simplified model would also accurately represent rates of
            intramuscular reaction fluxes measured <i>in vivo</i>. To do this, I contacted Dr Bartlett who provided me with original data from a 31P-MRS imaging study performed on human quadricep muscle during 
            continuous isotonic knee extension exercise last 4 minuites. The data from the study allow an estimation of ATP synthesis by each major pathway; that is, 
            glycolysis, mitochondrial ATP synthase, and phosphocreatine (PCr) breakdown. 

            FBA analysis assumes steady-state concentrates of intramusuclar metabolites (except certain specific cases, including input carbon sources and lactate excretion). 
            However, in the first seconds of exercise a large amount of phosphocreatine (PCr) is broken down to regenerate ATP. This PCr store is absent from the model. When filtering 
            out approximately the first ~60 seconds of data (to obtain steady-state PCr concentrations), the data from Dr Bartlett's study correspond closely to the reaction fluxes 
            predicted in the LDHm/MCTm model. 
        </p>


        <p>In order to determine which model occurs in vivo, I next sought potential ways to experimentally differentiate between the two models. The first step was to identify reactions
            which carry different fluxes at a given rate of ATP synthesis. I therefore wrote a short python script to check which reactions differ between the two models at a given ATP flux.
            This produced the following list:
            <br>
            ['HMR_3949', 'HMR_4139', 'HMR_4141', 'HMR_4388', 'HMR_4926', 'MT_LDH', 'MT_MCT']
            <br>
            Because the LDHm and original models produce identical O2 conspumtion curves, they would be challenging to differentiate experimentally in vivo. 
            The only reactions which
            differ between 
        </p>
